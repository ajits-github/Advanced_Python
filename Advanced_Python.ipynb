        "GIL is a lock based concept which is of more concerns for the tasks related to CPU and a less of a limitation when it comes to I/O bound tasks. This is because I/O bound tasks generally involve lots of waiting. For example, reading or wirting the files, or network communications or interacting with a database etc., where one thread has to wait and hence GIL releases the lock and the service to be used by other threads. These tasks are limited by the speed of the input/output operations and typically involve more waiting than actual computation."

        "The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python can have a significant impact on CPU-bound tasks because it restricts the execution of Python bytecode to a single thread. As a result, even when multiple threads are used for CPU-bound tasks, they won't run in true parallel on multi-core processors due to the GIL.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, there are strategies to mitigate the impact of the GIL on CPU-bound tasks and potentially speed up their execution:\n",
        "- Use **Multiprocessing**: Instead of using threads, you can use the multiprocessing module to create separate processes. Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, allowing them to run in true parallel, as the GIL doesn't affect processes. This approach leverages multiple CPU cores effectively for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use **Compiled Extensions**: Consider using compiled extensions or libraries written in languages like C or Cython for performance-critical sections of your code. These languages can bypass the GIL and perform computations more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use **Concurrency Libraries**: Libraries like concurrent.futures provide higher-level interfaces for executing CPU-bound tasks concurrently using threads or processes. They abstract the management of threads and processes, allowing you to focus on the task logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Use **GIL-Free Libraries**: Some Python libraries and tools, like NumPy and pandas, are designed to work efficiently with large arrays and data frames and can bypass the GIL. Utilizing such libraries can speed up computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Consider Using **Other Languages**: For extremely CPU-intensive tasks, you might consider using other programming languages like C, C++, or Rust that don't have a GIL and offer better performance."
