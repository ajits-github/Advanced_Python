This duration of waiting can be restricted by using 'timeout' in join() which allows the later code to run if, for example, the timeout is smaller than sleep time inside the function called on that thread. This is the same effect achived by not using join(). The results will be same in both the cases as it can be seen from the above output where Thread 2 is still running though it didn't print the statement inside new_task() function. Observe the outputs by commenting line 18 and 19, and then uncomment line 19. However, now comment line 19 and uncomment 18, you will see the difference as why we need join().\n",
